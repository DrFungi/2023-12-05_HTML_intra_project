# Initiation_HTML

This project will allow me to practice my HTML and CSS skills. Additionally I will be able to practice git and github

I learned:
1. how to set up a navbar
2. How to do internal and external links
3. How to do format images
4. how to format the overall look of a web page


I found most rewarding the setting up of the navbar because it allowed me to understand the the flexbox structure in CSS
A next step for this project would be to build an html file for each database and to format all the contents as flexbox

The code for this project can be seen in the below kink
